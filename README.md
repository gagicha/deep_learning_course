On the way to do deep learning speacialization from Coursear by Andrew NG!

Course1 completed on August 28, 2018.

Learnings:
1. Building a cat v/s non-cat classifier using Logistic regression, 2 layer neural network and an L-layer neural network.
2. Learned to build individual components like initialize parameters, forward propogation function, cost function, backward propogation function and updatie parameters. 
3. Integrating all the components together to build a deep neural network.
